                <p>
                    This quote encompasses the path that Alix Grillo
                    has been on in her career. As a mathematics and history major graduate from Gonzaga University, she
                    was destined
                    to be consumed by the insurance industry in one form or another. In her ten years at Great-West
                    Financial, she
                    performed a variety of jobs, including business systems, sales/marketing, operations, and project
                    and relationship
                    management. During this time, she also completed an MBA in Risk Management from University of
                    Colorado Denver.

                    Then, an amazing thing happened... she took a chance on something that would change her life
                    forever. Her boyfriend
                    - who would later be her husband - took an apprenticeship in a small town outside Edinburgh,
                    Scotland and took Alix
                    with him. During her time there, she completed an MSc in Business Analytics from the University of
                    Edinburgh. This
                    opened a world of opportunity because she did not even realize how far the world of business
                    analytics and data
                    science stretched. She was exposed to algorithms, processes, and technical capabilities that she did
                    know existed. Her
                    capstone work was research to determine a novel approach to solving a resource problem in airport
                    operations using a
                    hybrid simulation and heuristic approach. This work is being published as part of the Winter
                    Simulation Conference.

                    All of these twists and turns have led Alix to discover her passion for software and web
                    development. In her current
                    role at Charles Schwab as Manager, Risk Analytics, she has opportunities to contribute to the
                    information system
                    supporting her team using a .NET framework with a desktop and web version. As this system is still
                    very much in the
                    development phases, Alix has seen the system come to life. Alix can bring aspects of all her walks
                    of life to a
                    software engineering career and add value to any project that she takes part in.
