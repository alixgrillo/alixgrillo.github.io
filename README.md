# Bootstrap-Portfolio Version 1.0 10/1/2019
portfolio pages using bootstrap

## Description
------------------------------------------------
- Homework #2 was to modify the professional portfolio site using
HTML/CSS using Bootstrap. This should be committed to a GitHub repository and published using GitPages.

- There are 3 HTML pages that will be described below. Each page
will share the same header style. The header contains a logo that contains
my name and a naviation bar that will direct the user to each of the 
3 pages. There is a footer fixed on each page that contains "Copyright" as a placeholder for any future disclosures.

- The navigation bar and the grid of the page should be styled using Bootstrap
(https://getbootstrap.com/). The purpose of this is to utilize CSS functionality
already specified by Bootstrap. This assists in mobile responsiveness as well. For 
other portions of the page, such as form, card links, and footers, there is 
efficiency to be gained by using Bootstrap as well. 

- About (index.html): The About tab contains a header "About Me"
and block text in paragraph form. This is a brief bio about me and contains
one image.

- Portfolio (portfolio.html): The Portfolio tab contains a header "Portfolio"
and 5 placeholder links (each containing a picture and text) for future links
to portfolio projects. These images are two across and stacked vertically. The
text should be overlayed on the image and positioned toward the bottom of the 
image spanning the entire width of the image. This is done using the Bootstrap
card functionality.

- Contact (index.html): The Contact tab contains a header "Contact"
and a form capturing 3 pieces of information: Name (with John Smith as an 
example), Email (with example@gmail.com as an example), and Message (default to 
blank). There is a Submit button, which changes colors and cursor style when 
cursor hovers over the button.

- The primary colors used are #4aaaa5 (all teal section), #777777 font color,
#ffffff for main header and main content background, #666666 for the footer background, and #dddddd for main content border color. A new background image
was introduce for the page background as well as the content background.

- The header font is 'Great Vibes' and content font is 'Roboto'. These were both
using Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).

- All images are contained within the repository in /images folder. Any extra styling above and beyond the Bootstrap functionality is completed by CSS file contained in /css folder. There are also background image options
stored in /background.
